# NoSQL Injection

**NoSQL Injection** is a security vulnerability that occurs when unvalidated or improperly sanitized user inputs are embedded in NoSQL database queries, allowing attackers to manipulate these queries and gain unauthorized access, extract data, or perform malicious operations. This vulnerability arises primarily in NoSQL databases like MongoDB, which allow dynamic query building and typically lack the structured query language of traditional SQL databases.

### How NoSQL Injection Works:

In NoSQL injection attacks, attackers can craft input to alter query logic, often leveraging JSON or BSON formats. For example, by injecting special characters or structured JSON objects into input fields, attackers can change query behavior, bypass authentication, or retrieve sensitive information. Unlike SQL, NoSQL databases are more flexible with data structures, making it easier for attackers to manipulate the data without traditional SQL-style commands.

Key elements of NoSQL Injection:

- **Unvalidated User Inputs** are accepted in NoSQL queries without proper sanitation or validation.
- **Manipulation of JSON objects** can allow attackers to bypass access controls or modify database responses.
- **Mitigations** include input validation, avoiding user-controlled queries, and using parameterized queries or prepared statements where possible.

This shows a user interface where a coupon code can be entered. Users may enter codes, expecting discounts or benefits applied to their accounts. However, without proper validation, this input can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious payloads. This page is further explored in BurpSuit and further analyzed.

- This response shows that the application attempted to validate the coupon code but resulted in an internal server error (500). This error suggests that the backend might not be handling input validation or sanitization properly, potentially exposing the application to NoSQL injection attacks. Such an error can indicate that the backend attempted to process malformed data, which caused the application to crash.
- The payload in this case was a simple JSON with a "coupon_code": "coupon" field, which did not succeed. However, it suggests that the system accepts user input directly in a JSON format, a common vector for NoSQL injection.

A MongoDB operator, `"$ne":1`, is injected into the "coupon_code" field, resulting in a successful response from the server.

The server responded with a coupon code (`"TRAC075"`) and an associated discount amount of `75`, suggesting that the injection bypassed the intended validation and manipulated the database query to return valid data. This is a clear example of NoSQL injection as it uses MongoDBâ€™s `$ne` (not equal) operator to manipulate query results and retrieve sensitive information.

Based on the critical nature of preventing NoSQL injection attacks and securing enterprise-level applications, the top four most important mitigations are:

1. **Input Validation and Escaping**
    - Ensure all input data, especially JSON objects, are strictly validated. Reject any inputs that contain special characters or operators (like `$` or `{}`) unless explicitly allowed. Implement whitelist validation, where only expected formats and values are accepted.
    - Proper input validation is essential as it prevents malicious payloads from reaching the database, serving as the first line of defense against injection attacks.

2. **Use Parameterized Queries or Object Relational Mapping (ORM) Libraries**
    - Use parameterized queries or ORM libraries to separate code logic from query structure. This approach makes it difficult for injected code to alter the query logic, as ORMs and parameterized queries treat inputs as data, not executable commands.
    - Parameterized queries prevent NoSQL operators from being injected as user input, significantly reducing the risk of injection attacks.
    - Industry Standard Tools: **Mongoose** for MongoDB (Node.js), SQLAlchemy, **Django ORM** (Python) and **Entity Framework** (C#)
3. **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for Authentication and Authorization**
    - Require OAuth 2.0 and OIDC for API authentication and authorization. Use short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens to limit exposure. Ensure tokens are scoped to only allow necessary access for specific user roles.
    - OAuth 2.0 and OIDC ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive parts of the system, preventing unauthorized access risks.
    - Industry Standard Tools: **Auth0**, **Okta**, **AWS Cognito**, or **Azure AD** that offer robust OAuth 2.0 and OIDC integrations.
4. **API Gateway and Centralized Access Management**
    - Deploy an API gateway to enforce security policies, such as authentication, rate limiting, and content filtering, across all API requests. The gateway acts as a single control point, enforcing consistent security measures across the application.
    - An API gateway provides centralized management and enforcement, allowing real-time monitoring and blocking of malicious traffic before it reaches the backend services.
